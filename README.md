## Installation

r404 works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'r404'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install r404

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'r404', github: 'jonhue/r404'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g r404

Finally add `include R404Controller` to your `ApplicationController` located in `app/controllers/application_controller.rb`.

## Usage

### Raising an error

You can raise errors in controllers and views:

```ruby
r404 :not_found

# more specific
r404 404
```

**Note:** The status parameter defaults to `404`.

You are able to pass exception details which will be available in your template:

```ruby
r404 :not_found, 'Here is what went wrong ...'
```

Alternatively you can raise errors from anywhere by raising the [error class](#list-of-all-error-classes) directly:

```ruby
raise R404::NotFound
```

### Rendering an error

r404 automatically looks up templates in the `app/views/r404` directory. The `status` and `exception` (if passed) variables are available in your template.

Often you don't want to render a template, but instead your goal is to redirect back passing an alert. You are able to override error specific methods in your `ApplicationController`:

```ruby
private

def render_r404_access_denied format, status, exception
    format.html { redirect_back fallback_location: root_url, alert: 'You are unauthorized to perform this action' }
end
```

#### Rendering external errors

A lot of errors can be thrown in a Rails application. You can rescue and render them from your `ApplicationController`, here is a very basic configuration:

```ruby
rescue_from CanCan::AccessDenied do |exception|
    render_r404 :access_denied, 403, exception
end
rescue_from ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, AbstractController::ActionNotFound, ActionController::RoutingError do |exception|
    render_r404 :not_found, 404, exception
end
```

### List of all error classes

* `R404::AccessDenied` (`:access_denied`, `403`)
* `R404::NotFound` (`:not_found`, `404`)
