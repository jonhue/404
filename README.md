## Installation

r404 works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'r404'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install r404

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'r404', github: 'jonhue/r404'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g r404

Finally add `include R404Controller` to your `ApplicationController` located in `app/controllers/application_controller.rb`.

## Usage

### Raising an error

You can raise errors in controllers and views:

```ruby
r404 :not_found

# more specific
r404 404
```

Alternatively you can raise errors from anywhere by raising the [error class](#list-of-all-error-classes) directly:

```ruby
raise R404::NotFound
```

### Rendering an error

r404 automatically looks up templates in the `app/views/r404` directory.

### List of all error classes

* `R404::AccessDenied` (`:access_denied`, `403`)
* `R404::NotFound` (`:not_found`, `404`)
